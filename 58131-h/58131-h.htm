<h2>READ THIS FIRST.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> hero of this hazardous exploration through Hell is <b>Hiprah Hunt</b>, a
lecturer, reformer, ex-preacher, poet and president of a Dante Club.</p>

<p><b>Hiprah Hunt has no tolerance for the modern philosophy that denies the
existence of Hell.</b> As a preacher he was what men of the present day call
a “back number.”</p>

<p><b>Despite “higher criticism” he continually and earnestly advocates the
justice of future punishment</b>, and for this reason is known in the town
where he lives as “Hell-fire Hunt.”</p>

<p>Not unlikely his belief in a Demon-haunted Hell ruled over by a personal
Devil is in part due to atavism, for Mr. Hunt is a descendant of the
illustrious Hunts who lent their aid to the extermination of witches in
that part of New England where witchcraft once flourished.</p>

<p>As President of a Dante Club he collected many books on the subject of
future retribution. Among them (some 80 volumes) he chiefly prizes
Dante’s Inferno. Whenever he is given an opportunity he will deliver a
lecture on Dante and his work. In short, Hell books have so thoroughly
absorbed his mind that he becomes convinced that the under-world is as
much a reality as the upper one.</p>

<p>As a result of continual thinking on one subject, and that subject a hot
one, it was frequently hinted that Mr. Hunt’s brains were shrivelling
up. Whether that is true or not, <b>he became imbued with the idea that he
must find the Infernal Regions and prove to the world that the place is
not a myth</b>.</p>

<p>In the Fall of 1900 Mr. Hunt mysteriously disappeared from home. For six
weeks nothing was seen or heard of him. When he returned he set to work
immediately and wrote a poem consisting of sixty-eight cantos of blank
verse, curiously mixed with prose, quotations and numerous foot-notes.
<b>This poem, he declares, is the account of a six weeks’ journey through
Hell.</b></p>

<p>Mr. Hunt’s original manuscript which is in possession of the writer,
together with odd charts, maps, diagrams and thermometric records, all
of them bearing marks of having come from a very hot region, are strong
proofs of the authenticity of his exploration.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is unnecessary to add that the author has taken many
liberties with Mr. Hunt’s text. The condition of the documents
necessitated certain guess-work, and he has freely added a number of
Inferno pictures that were drawn long before Hiprah Hunt’s valuable
papers came to his notice.</p>

<p><b>If he has illuminated the dark and serious subject with a suspicion of
fun&mdash;it is meant to convey the hope he feels for all sinners like
himself, that some relief of a slightly humorous nature may be found
even in Hell.</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">There</span> are many portraits of Dante giving a more soulfully poetic cast to
his countenance and which are much more pleasing for admirers of the
great Florentine, to look upon, than the one reproduced here; but this
is the first portrait ever published which is intended to portray the
way the poet must really have felt at the termination of his trip
through the Infernal Regions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

where he delivered his unique lecture on Dante, and spent the rest of
his time sight-seeing and searching for literature on his favorite
subject.</p>

<p>Tired and confused with the busy scenes and active incidents of the day,
he is returning by night train to his home. As usual, when traveling, he
reads his Divine Comedy. He has not read far when he is overcome by a
sense of drowsiness. Sleepily, he reviews the events of the day in the
bustling city while musing over the grewsome scenes in his book. What
with the thoughts of high buildings, cable cars, of arch-heretics in
their fiery tombs, slot machines, automobiles and gibbering ghosts, of
swift-running elevators and headless spirits, of well-dressed gamblers
and “Adam’s evil brood” at large, his mind is truly in a chaotic state.</p>

car. A sudden lurch of the train as it turns round a curve in the track
and he finds himself lying prone by the road side.</p>

<p>On either hand there stretches a boundless forest of the wildest
desolation. Overhead a ghostly night wind ploughs through the tree tops
and wails and sobs like a lost spirit. Amidst a whizzing of invisible
bats and the hoots of melancholy owls, he struggles to his feet. Combing
the gravel out of his long locks he sets forth in a southeasterly
direction.</p>

deep chasms and black ravines, he stumbles toward the Unseen. When his
emotions have abated he finds himself alone in the heart of a forest,
where trees are so thickly crowded that the air is dense and hard to
breathe.</p>

<p>Finally, he comes to a projecting precipice from which he peers and
discerns a dim light through the sluggishly rising smoke. As he crawls
lower he hears voices, and a great commotion. An odor of burning
brimstone fills the air. He swings out from an over-hanging rock and
allows himself to drop.</p>

throng of Demons, sinners and employees of the realm. Crowds of men are
getting overcoats checked and buying fans. He buys one himself, and also
secures a guide book, locating the different sections and departments.
He sees over the portal’s lofty arch the words “Leave all hope on the
outside.” This demand he will not entirely accede to. He retains a
little, thinking he may need it later on.</p>

<p>Because Mr. Hunt shows no evidence of having died, the goblin custodian
who watches the entrance will not allow him to pass. Mr. Hunt does not
deny that he is alive, but explains that he is about the only prominent
champion of future punishment living and deserves special consideration.</p>

<p>He further argues that inasmuch as Dante was admitted without question
through the Italian entrance, he ought to be granted an equal privilege
on the American side.</p>

objection, and Mr. Hunt proceeds.</p>

punished severely, but are allowed to exist “desiring without hope.” He
is approached by shrouded spirits who describe themselves as a school of
poets, and instantly recalling how Dante in his peregrinations ran
across Homer, he enquires for that worthy.</p>

<p>He learns that this is quite another group to that in which the ancient
bard moves. These are the unworthies who spent their time on earth
writing bad poetry when they would have been better engaged sawing wood

through the Empire from the Devil himself. Though Demons pursue him with
persistency he succeeds in reaching a huge arched entrance in an immense
purple rock. Over it is a blazing inscription reading: “Satan’s office.”
Here Mr. Hunt pauses. For a moment he is afraid. He regains his courage,
and, mounting an elaborate fire-escape, enters. “As a night-hawk cleaves
a side flight in the sky,” says the poet-explorer, “so the great
arch-enemy of mankind wheeled round in his chair as I entered.”</p>

<p>Hiprah Hunt finds himself in great danger of being cast into Hell-fire
before he can make known the object of his presence. When he explains
that he has been a lifelong expounder of the future punishment theory,
that his purpose is to explore the region and go back to earth with the
proof of his belief, Satan shows great courtesy. He immediately
telephones to the heads of the departments in his realm to assemble at
Plutoblitzz, the Central Station of the region, and to receive Mr. Hunt
with a great ovation.</p>

three official newspapers “The Daily Groan,” “Hot Times” and “The Yelp.”</p>

announces that Mr. Hunt will make a speech.</p>

<h3>THE SPEECH OF HIPRAH HUNT.</h3>

<p class="c">(From an extra edition of the Daily Groan.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">“Your Majesty, Demons, Fiends and Imps:</p>

<p>“I thank you for this ovation. This, the Hell of my forefathers,
with such improvements as you have made, is good enough for me.</p>

<p>“So long as man waxes fat in folly and vice on earth without a
worried conscience, the world will need this region and must
throttle the voice of the so-called ‘wise-man’ who says it’s a
myth. (Flapping of wings and roar of thunder.)</p>

<p>“I stand here on ground trod by the immortal Dante (loud cheers for
Dante and flash of green fire), that great Italian who blazed the
way for my own coming. To carry on the work of this great man is no
easy task; but with the permission of your most Imperial High Ruler
and yourselves, I hope to get about and see a few things that will
startle millions of people who have ceased to be frightened at the
thought of eternal damnation. (Loud reports of bursting
thermometers.)</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it serve men right who think they can go through life
cheating, cursing, liquor-drinking, lying and raising Cain
generally to find in the end that it’s time to pay up. (A thousand
voices: Sure! Give it to ’em; Hunt’s all right.) On all the winds
of the upper world are borne the croaking of the crows of modern
thought. But depend upon it, one voice, the voice of Hiprah Hunt,
shall always be raised against them in defence of this great
Infernal Empire.</p>

<p>“Again I thank you all, particularly the musicians, for this
tribute of esteem.”</p></div>

<p>(Part of the band then strike up the “magic-fire scene,” from “Die
Walküre,” while the rest play “He’s a jolly good fellow” in rag time.
The crowd cheers lustily and the affair ends with a magnificent display
of fireworks.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

were sold on earth to enrich the inventor, but were of no benefit

punishment of gulping their own poison, unceasing showers of large pills
descend, the doctors frantically beating the air in their endeavors to

sand-paper. As they stand cringing in fright, a Demon policeman yells:
“Next!” and the foremost shuffles to the front and is given a shove that
sends him whirling, yelling and rasping down the incline at a fearful
speed. Arriving at the bottom he is immediately driven back and forced

<p>The Arch-Fiend receives him courteously and tells him that he is much
interested in the result of his labors, assuring him that he is
appreciative of his desire to offset the tendency of modern thinkers to
dispense entirely with future punishment. He prevails on Mr. Hunt to
remain in the region till after the Annual Parade of Sinners. Mr. Hunt
agrees to do so&mdash;and accepts the Chief’s invitation to be his guest

Satan’s palace on the Styx.</p>

<p>As guest of honor he sits at one end of a long table and Satan sits at
the other. He describes the magnificence of the scene and his meeting
with the members of the Hell Common Council.</p>

<p>Charming women from the female department wait on the table.</p>

<p>When in response to a toast Mr. Hunt tells the Demons that a great
majority of the civilized world think Hell only a bugaboo dream, they
are convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>The banquet over, Hiprah Hunt bids farewell to Satan and his colleagues.
The Arch-Fiend asks him to come again, and Mr. Hunt promises to do so if
he recovers from the exploration just ended.</p>

<p>Taking an ascending car back to the American entrance he climbs out into
the upper world, through the same wild forest he had passed six weeks
before. Under a star-lit sky he makes his way home with proofs that Hell
really is; that Dante was right, and that Hiprah Hunt is his legitimate
successor.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Hunt adds the following verse, the wisdom of which no
reader will deny who has followed the explorer’s journey below, or
better still followed his own life, noting the penalties that resulted
from folly and disobedience of laws of right living here on earth:</p>

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
